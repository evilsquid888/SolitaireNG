Simple solitaire game.

Currently documentation is limited but I will add comments to the source and
detail the structure in here. 

Build Instructions:
------------------
I do not use eclipse so I can't really guarantee that it will build in that
environment. 

First off you need to download the SDK from http://code.google.com/android.
Once installed you need to modify solitaire's build.xml file to include the
path to the SDK (Two lines near the top). Then running ant should complete the
job. If you have difficulties, try building a sample program from
code.google.com first which has a bunch of detail and troubleshooting info.

----------------------
It's now a proper Eclipse project. Original author is still Ken Magic.
Modifications by Josua Dietze (2010):

- "Deal" menu entry (only relevant for Spider on devices with
  fewer hardware keys)
- Dynamic card size (for those big screen devices)
- Preferences converted to list

Modifications by Josua Dietze (2011):
- Dynamic card size and automatic card set selection fine tuned to
  consider absolute and relative device resolution (DPI)


Current version: 1.12.1-ng3
